## Internet

**Definition**: Global network of interconnected networks

The Internet is essentially a "network of networks" - smaller networks connected together to form one massive, worldwide communication system.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Worldwide connectivity** across continents
- **Decentralized structure** - no single point of control
- **Public infrastructure** accessible to anyone
- **Enables multiple services** - web browsing, email, file sharing
- **Scalable architecture** that grows with demand

### Real-World Analogy
Think of the Internet like a highway system:
- Local roads (home networks) connect to highways (ISPs)
- Highways connect to major interstates (backbone networks)
- The entire system allows travel anywhere in the world

## Protocols

**Definition**: Set of rules and standards that define how devices communicate

Protocols are like languages that computers use to talk to each other. Just as humans need a common language to communicate, devices need agreed-upon protocols.

### Purpose:
- Define **communication rules** between devices
- Specify **data formats** and **message structures**
- Determine **what type of data** is being shared
- Ensure **reliable delivery** of information

### Common Protocol Examples:

| Protocol | Full Name | Purpose | Example Use |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | HyperText Transfer Protocol | Web browsing and secure communication | Loading websites |
| **TCP/IP** | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol | Data transmission backbone | All internet communication |
| **SMTP** | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Email sending | Sending emails |
| **FTP** | File Transfer Protocol | File transfers | Downloading/uploading files |
| **DNS** | Domain Name System | Name-to-IP address translation | Converting google.com to IP |
| **DHCP** | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol | Automatic IP assignment | Getting IP when connecting to WiFi |

### Protocol Stack Concept
Protocols work in layers, each handling specific tasks:
```
Application Layer    →    HTTP, SMTP, FTP
Transport Layer      →    TCP, UDP  
Network Layer        →    IP
Physical Layer       →    Ethernet, WiFi
```

## Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network.

- **Advantages**: Equal access for all devices, predictable performance
- **Disadvantages**: One device failure can break entire network
- **Use Case**: Token Ring networks (mostly legacy)

### **Mesh Topology**
- **Structure**: Every device connected to every other device
- **Types**: Full Mesh (all-to-all), Partial Mesh (some-to-some)
- **Advantages**: Highly reliable, multiple paths available
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, complex to manage
- **Use Case**: Critical networks, internet backbone

### **Tree (Hierarchical) Topology**
- **Structure**: Combines star and bus topologies in hierarchy
- **Advantages**: Scalable, organized structure
- **Disadvantages**: Complex, dependent on root node
- **Use Case**: Large organizations, ISP networks

- **Use Case**: When feedback is not required

### **Half Duplex**
- **Definition**: Data flows in BOTH directions, but only ONE at a time
- **Characteristics**: Bidirectional but not simultaneous
- **Examples**: Walkie-talkies, CB radio, some WiFi communications
- **Use Case**: When bidirectional communication needed but simultaneous not required

### **Full Duplex**
- **Definition**: Data flows in BOTH directions SIMULTANEOUSLY
- **Characteristics**: Bidirectional and simultaneous
- **Examples**: Telephone calls, modern Ethernet, fiber optic cables
- **Use Case**: Most modern network communications, real-time applications

## Key Relationships

Understanding how these concepts work together:

### Network Type Hierarchy:
```
PAN (Personal) → LAN (Local) → CAN (Campus) → MAN (Metropolitan) → WAN (Wide)
```

### Topology Selection:
- **Small networks**: Bus or Star topology
- **Medium networks**: Tree or Hybrid topology
- **Critical systems**: Mesh topology for redundancy
- **Large enterprises**: Hybrid topology combining multiple types

### Device Interaction:
- **Switches** connect devices within same network (LAN level)
- **Routers** connect different networks (between LANs, to WAN)
- **Default Gateway** is typically your local router's address

### Transmission Mode Applications:
- **Simplex**: Broadcasting, sensor data collection
- **Half Duplex**: Cost-effective bidirectional communication
- **Full Duplex**: Modern high-performance networks

### Edge to Core Connection:
- **Devices create edge points** - every computer, phone, etc. is an edge device
- **Infrastructure forms the core** - routers, switches, cables connect the edges
- **Data flows from edge through core to edge** - your device → core network → destination device

### Protocol Integration:
- **Protocols enable all communication** - both edge and core devices use protocols
- **Different protocols for different purposes** - HTTP for web, SMTP for email
- **Protocol layers work together** - each layer handles specific tasks

### Perspective Complementarity:
- **Nuts and Bolts = "How it works"** - technical implementation details
- **Services = "What it provides"** - user benefits and applications
- **Both views needed** - technical understanding AND user value

### Network Hierarchy:
```
Internet (Global WAN)
    ↓
ISP Networks (Regional WAN/MAN)
    ↓
Local Networks (LAN/CAN)
    ↓
