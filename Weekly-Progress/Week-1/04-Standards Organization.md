## Overview

Internet standards ensure that devices and networks worldwide can communicate effectively. Two key organizations lead this effort: the IETF develops standards, and RFC documents publish them.

### Simple Relationship
- **IETF** = Standards development organization (the "factory")
- **RFC** = Published documents (the "products")

## RFC (Request for Comments)

### What is RFC?
**RFC** is a document system that publishes internet technical specifications and standards.

### Key Characteristics
- **Numbered series** - RFC 1, RFC 2, RFC 3... (now in thousands)
- **Publicly available** - free access to all documents
- **Permanent archive** - RFCs never change once published
- **Broad scope** - covers protocols, best practices, experimental ideas

### Famous RFC Examples

| RFC Number | Year | Title | Significance |
|------------|------|--------|--------------|
| **RFC 791** | 1981 | Internet Protocol (IP) | Defines IPv4 - still used today |
| **RFC 793** | 1981 | Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | Core internet transport protocol |
| **RFC 2616** | 1999 | HTTP/1.1 | Web browsing standard |
| **RFC 5321** | 2008 | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) | Email sending protocol |
| **RFC 7540** | 2015 | HTTP/2 | Modern web protocol |
| **RFC 9000** | 2021 | QUIC Protocol | Next-generation transport protocol |

### Types of RFC Documents

**Standards Track**
- **Proposed Standard** - Initial version for review
- **Draft Standard** - Tested and refined version  
- **Internet Standard** - Final, approved version

**Non-Standards Track**
- **Informational** - General information and documentation
- **Experimental** - New ideas being tested
- **Best Current Practice** - Recommended procedures
- **Historic** - Outdated standards kept for reference

### Fun RFC Facts
- **RFC 1149** (1990) - "IP over Avian Carriers" (internet via pigeons!) - April Fools' joke
- **RFC 2324** (1998) - "Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol" - Another April Fools' RFC
- **RFC 3514** (2003) - "The Security Flag in the IPv4 Header" (evil bit) - April Fools' tradition

- Community review and feedback
- Multiple revisions and improvements
- Interoperability testing

**4. Working Group Last Call**
- Final review within working group
- Last chance for major changes
- Consensus on final version
- Forward to IESG for approval

**5. IESG Review**
- Technical review by area directors
- Security and architectural review
- Can approve, request changes, or reject
- Final quality gate before publication

**6. RFC Publication**
- Approved document gets RFC number
- Published in permanent archive
- Available to global community
- Standard becomes official
