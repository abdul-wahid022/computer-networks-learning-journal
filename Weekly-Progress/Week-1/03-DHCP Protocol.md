## What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is like an automatic receptionist that assigns addresses and network settings to devices when they join a network.

### Simple Analogy
Think of DHCP like a hotel check-in desk:
- **Guest arrives** → Front desk assigns room number → Gives room key and hotel rules
- **Device connects** → DHCP server assigns IP → Gives network settings

### Core Purpose
DHCP automates the process of configuring network settings for devices, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## The Problem DHCP Solves

### Before DHCP (Manual Configuration)
**Administrator's nightmare**:
1. Visit each computer physically
2. Manually configure:
   - IP address (192.168.1.100)
   - Subnet mask (255.255.255.0)  
   - Gateway (192.168.1.1)
   - DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
3. Keep track of which IPs are used
4. Avoid duplicate IP conflicts

**Problems**:
- Time consuming for large networks
- Human errors (duplicate IPs)
- Difficult to track IP usage
- Hard to make network changes

### After DHCP (Automatic Configuration)
**Smooth automation**:
1. Device connects to network
2. DHCP automatically assigns all settings
3. Device starts working immediately
4. No human intervention needed

## DHCP Components

### DHCP Server
**Role**: The "address distributor"
- Maintains pool of available IP addresses
- Assigns network configuration to clients
- Keeps track of which device has which IP
- Can be a router, server, or dedicated appliance

### DHCP Client
**Role**: The "address requester"
- Any device that needs network configuration
- Examples: laptops, phones, printers, smart TVs
- Automatically requests IP when connecting

### IP Address Pool (Scope)
**Role**: The "available addresses"

**Example pool**:
```
Start IP: 192.168.1.100
End IP: 192.168.1.200
Total addresses: 101 addresses available
```

### Lease Time
**Role**: "How long can you keep this address?"
- Duration a device can use the assigned IP
- Example: 24 hours, 7 days, or permanent
- Device must renew before lease expires

---

## The DHCP Process (DORA)

The famous 4-step handshake every device goes through:

### Step 1: DISCOVER (Device broadcasts)
**New device**: "Hello network! I need an IP address!"

**Technical details**:
- Device sends broadcast message (255.255.255.255)
- Message: "DHCP DISCOVER"
- Reaches all devices on network
- Multiple DHCP servers may hear this

### Step 2: OFFER (Server responds)
**DHCP Server**: "I can give you 192.168.1.105!"

**Technical details**:
- Server checks available IP pool
- Selects unused IP address
- Sends "DHCP OFFER" with:
  - IP address (192.168.1.105)
  - Subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
  - Gateway (192.168.1.1)
  - DNS servers (8.8.8.8)
  - Lease time (24 hours)

### Step 3: REQUEST (Device accepts)
**Device**: "Yes, I'll take 192.168.1.105!"

**Technical details**:
- Device broadcasts "DHCP REQUEST"
- Confirms it wants the offered IP
- Other DHCP servers withdraw their offers
- Final step before getting the IP

### Step 4: ACKNOWLEDGE (Server confirms)
**Server**: "Confirmed! IP 192.168.1.105 is yours!"

**Technical details**:
- Server sends "DHCP ACK" (acknowledgment)
- Marks IP as "in use" in its database
- Device configures network interface
- Device can now communicate on network

### DORA Process Flow
```
Client                    Server
  |                         |
  |--- DISCOVER (Broadcast) |
  |                         |
  |         OFFER ----------|
  |                         |
  |--- REQUEST (Broadcast)  |
  |                         |
  |         ACK ------------|
  |                         |
```

## DHCP Configuration

### What DHCP Assigns Automatically

**Essential Network Settings**:
- **IP Address**: Unique identifier (192.168.1.105)
- **Subnet Mask**: Network boundaries (255.255.255.0)
- **Default Gateway**: Router IP (192.168.1.1)
- **DNS Servers**: Name resolution (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)

**Optional Settings**:
- **Domain Name**: Company domain (example.com)
- **WINS Servers**: Windows name resolution
- **NTP Servers**: Time synchronization
- **TFTP Servers**: Boot file locations

### DHCP Reservations (Static DHCP)
**Purpose**: Guarantee specific IP to specific device

**Example reservation**:
```
Device: Office Printer
MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  
Reserved IP: 192.168.1.50
Result: Printer always gets same IP (192.168.1.50)
```

**When to use**:
- Servers that need consistent IPs
- Printers for easy access
- Network devices (cameras, access points)
- Critical infrastructure equipment

### Static vs Dynamic DHCP Approach

**Static DHCP (Reservations) - Core Infrastructure**
Best Practice: Reserve IPs for critical devices
- ✅ **Routers**: 192.168.1.1 (gateway always same)
- ✅ **Switches**: 192.168.1.2 (management access)
- ✅ **Servers**: 192.168.1.10-20 (consistent access)
- ✅ **Printers**: 192.168.1.30-40 (shared resources)
- ✅ **IP Cameras**: 192.168.1.50-60 (monitoring)
- ✅ **Access Points**: 192.168.1.70-80 (WiFi management)

**Why Static**: Infrastructure needs predictable IPs!

**Dynamic DHCP - End Users**
Dynamic Pool for regular users:
- ✅ **Employee laptops**: 192.168.1.100-200
- ✅ **Mobile phones**: Same dynamic range
- ✅ **Tablets**: Same dynamic range
- ✅ **Guest devices**: 192.168.2.100-200

**Why Dynamic**: Users don't need consistent IPs!

### Benefits of Mixed Approach
- **Security**: Dynamic IPs make user tracking harder
- **Management**: Static core devices easy to access
- **Efficiency**: Optimal IP address utilization

## Lease Management

### Lease Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Active Lease (0-50% of lease time)**
- **Status**: Device uses IP normally
- **Action**: No action needed
- **Example**: Day 1-12 of 24-day lease

**Phase 2: Renewal Attempt (50% of lease time)**
- **Status**: Device tries to renew with same server
- **Action**: Sends renewal request
- **Example**: Day 12 of 24-day lease
- **Result**: Usually successful - lease extended

**Phase 3: Rebinding Attempt (87.5% of lease time)**
- **Status**: Renewal failed, tries any DHCP server
- **Action**: Broadcasts renewal to all servers
- **Example**: Day 21 of 24-day lease
- **Result**: Any server can extend lease

**Phase 4: Lease Expiration (100% of lease time)**
- **Status**: Lease expired, must restart DHCP process
- **Action**: Goes back to DISCOVER phase
- **Example**: Day 24 - starts over with DORA

### Lease Database
DHCP server maintains database of:

| IP Address | MAC Address | Lease End Time | Status |
|------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 192.168.1.100 | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E | 2025-09-20 10:30 | Active |
| 192.168.1.101 | 00:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F | 2025-09-19 15:45 | Expired |
| 192.168.1.102 | 00:3C:4D:5E:6F:7A | 2025-09-21 08:20 | Active |

## Security Considerations

### Security Threats

**DHCP Starvation Attack**
Attack method:
1. Attacker requests all available IPs
2. DHCP pool becomes exhausted
3. Legitimate devices can't get IPs
4. Network becomes unusable

**Rogue DHCP Server**
Attack method:
1. Attacker sets up fake DHCP server
2. Provides malicious network settings
3. Routes traffic through attacker's system
4. Can intercept all network traffic

### Security Best Practices
- **DHCP Snooping**: Switch feature to block unauthorized servers
- **IP Address Limits**: Restrict number of IPs per MAC address
- **DHCP Reservations**: Use for critical devices
- **Network Monitoring**: Watch for unusual DHCP activity
- **Regular Audits**: Check DHCP logs and lease database
